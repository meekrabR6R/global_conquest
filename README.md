Global Conquest
===============
This app is an online board game inspired by Risk. I developed it because my friends and I were dissatisfied with
all of the online Risk-inspired apps we found. It is currently in testing, but will be available at some point on 
Facebook's App Center. 

This project was primarly a learning exercise. As such, it is relatively imperfect. I learned a lot along the way,
and, based on what I have learned, there are a million things I would've done differently. However, it works well,
and is fairly well organized using the MVC framework 'Laravel.' Perhaps the most important lesson I learned while 
developing this app was to ditch PHP for Ruby ;).
