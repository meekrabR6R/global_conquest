Global Conquest

This app is an online board game inspired Risk. It is currently in testing, but will be available on Facebook's App
Center in the near future. 

This project primarly as a learning exercise. As such, it is relatively imperfect. However, it works well, and is fairly
well organized using the MVC framework 'Laravel.' Perhaps the most important lesson I learned while developing this
app was to ditch PHP for Ruby ;).
